    Lines object of a SpatialLinesDataFrame
    o   subset.linearmask() acquires argument droplinesbeyond for
    cleaning the SLDF attribute
    o   snapPointsToLinearMask() now snaps to the vertices of the graph
    attribute, rather than trying to use the maptools function snapPointsToLines()
    o   showpath() also returns mask coordinates along each selected path
    o   checkmoves() new utility function for detecting extreme moves
    o   plot.linearmask() now uses plot.mask allowing a wider range of options

Changes in version 1.0.1 (2014-11-02)

New features or changed behaviour of old functions
    o   read.linearmask will read directly from a polyline shapefile
    o   interpoint distances within a line are coerced to the correct spacing value
        (no longer simple Euclidean distances) 
    o   direct and precise algorithm for placing mask points along lines (no longer calls spsample) 
    o   edge editing functions redefined; function showedges() replaces showskips()
    o   make.line() enhanced (randomstart, endbuffer, clusters, multiline masks etc.)
    o   new function cleanskips() removes superfluous joins (automatic in read.linearmask)

Bugs fixed
    o   none yet

Other
    o   now 'Depends' on igraph package (always loaded)
    o   no longer exports alongmask() (use make.line())
